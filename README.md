# SQL Procedure Parser
![.NET Workflow](https://github.com/SimenNielsen/SQLQueryLineage/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

This project is a .NET console application that parses MS SQL stored procedures and generates column-level lineage in JSON format. The tool extracts information from the stored procedures and outputs a JSON file that contains information about the columns and their dependencies.

## Installation
Download that latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/SimenNielsen/SQL_Procedure_Parser/releases).

## Usage
To use the SQL Procedure Parser, you need to provide the following parameters:
1. .sql file containing the valid SQL Server query.
2. Default schema for your database.
3. Database relevant for the query.
4. Path to output .json file.

The json contains a list of events found in a specified file. Event types are:
* SELECT = 1
* SELECT INTO = 2
* INSERT = 3
* UPDATE = 4
* EXECUTE = 5

Some queries require a connection string to the query database, e.g. when the upstream is unclear when column alias is not mentioned. To allow connection to a specific database we need to set these 4 environment variables:
- SOURCE_HOST
- SOURCE_PORT
- SOURCE_USER
- SOURCE_PASS
<br>
To set environment variables in Windows Powershell: ```$env:SOURCE_HOST="localhost"```.

Example:
```
SQL_Procedure_Parser.exe "./udp_please_parse_me.sql" "dbo" "TestDB" "C:\Temp\Testing\out.json"
```

## Sample Output
The output file generated by the tool will contain a JSON array with information about each column and its dependencies. Given following query, here is the output json content.
### Input
Using the following parameters: ```"C:\Users\User\Documents\SQL\testing\sample_query.sql" "dbo" "TestDB" "C:\Users\User\Documents\SQL\testing\output\out.json"```
sample_query.sql:
```
CREATE PROCEDURE get_order_info @order_id INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT o.id AS order_id,
           o.customer_id,
           c.name AS customer_name,
           c.email AS customer_email,
           o.date AS order_date
    FROM orders o
    INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
    WHERE o.id = @order_id
END
```
### Output
```
